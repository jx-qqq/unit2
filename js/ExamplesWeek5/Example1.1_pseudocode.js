//GOAL: Proportional symbols representing attribute values of mapped features
//STEPS:
//Step 1. Create the Leaflet map--already done in createMap()
//Step 2. Import GeoJSON data--already done in getData()
//Step 3. Add circle markers for point features to the map--already done in AJAX callback
//Step 4. Determine the attribute for scaling the proportional symbols
//Step 5. For each feature, determine its value for the selected attribute
//Step 6. Give each feature's circle marker a radius based on its attribute value
